						<button class="accordion">Le Chateau d'Aurore</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<br><h4>Tutor</h4><br>
							<p>In 2018, I approached a local organism looking for volunteers and they put me on tutoring duty because of education level. This is where I discovered a talent for interacting with kids and helping them improve their relation towards academics endeavours. While being a tutor for le Chateau d'Aurore, I had the pleasure to work with and for great people.</p><br>

						<button class="accordion">Solidarité Haïti</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<br><h4>Webmaster</h4><br>
							<p> This non profit organism was founded by and is run partly by members of my extended family. They ask me for help with the website management. As the webmaster, I will periodicly update pages and add news with pictures and information relevant to the members.</p><br>

						<button class="accordion">AEMI</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<br><h4>Sponsors Vp (Winter 2015 to Winter 2016)</h4><br>
							<p>This student association was the conduit to all of my involvement in student life during my UQAC's bachelor degree in computer science. As the Sponsors vp, I had to contact new sponsors, keep in touch with existing ones and report to the executive comity.
							<h4>Extern Vp (Winter 2016 to Autumn 2016)</h4><br>
							<p>As the extern vp, I had to represent my association with the Mage-UQAC and along all of the other students association. I had to be the relay info to and from the students and the Mage-UQAC. I had to sit through lenghty and procedural meetings with all the other extern vps.</p><br>
							<h4>President (1<sup>st</sup> may 2016 to 1<sup>st</sup> may 2017)</h4><br>
							<p> For the last year of my Bachelors degree in computer science, I was elected president of my student association by my peers. As the president, I had to find other volunteers to help me do all that there is to do for the AEMI (association des étudiant.e.s en mathématique et informatique). I was very proud of the team and what we all accomplished together. The team was solid and almost full. We got great feedback from all university instances. I was even awarded "personality of the year" during the "gala de l'implication MAGE-UQAC 2016-2017."</p><br>

						<button class="accordion">WonderLAN</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<br><h4>Volunteer</h4><br>
							<p> The Wonderlan is a weekend of competitive gaming but also all of the planning that's involved in hosting such an event. For my first semester at the university, I wanted to meet new people and so I volunteered for the WonderLAN within my student association. I was mostly a handyman. I helped by placing tables and cables, setting up players and pc. Answering questions and helping overall.</p>

							<h4>Extern Vp</h4><br>
							<p>As part of my second year of volunteering for the WonderLAN, I was entrusted with the role of contacting partners for the event. Mediatise the event, on facebook and local medias. This edition (2015) was the biggest I was part of with over 200 attendees at the university cafeteria for over 48 hours straight.</p><br>

							<br><h4>Volunteer</h4><br>
							<p>WonderJam is an event that was happens twice a year, once in the fall semester and another in the winter. A game jam is a competition where teams have exactly 48 hours (or another time constraint) to design a playable and fun game with design constraints. For exemple, the theme is usually given by the event organisers exactly when the event starts. The Wonderjam is the game jam organised by the UQAC students in the AEMI student association. I really loved my first 2 experiences as a participant of the Wonderjam and so I decided to help. I was interviewed about the event on various local media stations like <a href="http://ici.radio-canada.ca/regions/saguenay-lac/2016/03/04/001-wonderjam-uqac-jeux-video.shtml" target="_blank">Radio-Canada</a>, KYK radio X and TVDLDERY (video). I was also part of the team setting up the room and helping participants finding their spot.</p><br>
							<h4>President</h4><br>
							<p>As part of my final 2 semesters in the university, I was elected president of the WonderJam team. As the president, I had to build a solid team of volunteers to help build the event twice. We also won the price of the best project that year as elected by my peers as part of the "gala de l'implication MAGE-UQAC 2016-2017."</p>

						<div class="panel">
							<iframe width="475" height="267" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtyMM2FSInc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
							<h4>Writer</h4><br>					
							<p> Multijoueur no longer exists, but it used to be a web outlet for reporting and reviewing geek culture and in particular video games. From 2013 to 2018 I was part of the writers and I wrote dozens of articles of opinions and reviews for that website. I even started a short lived video series where I was exploring early access games on Steam. I was playing, recording, editing and publishing the proccess.</p>

							<p>This was the result of me and 4 other devs teaming up for our first WonderJam during our very first semester at UQAC. I really was not able to code compared to my teammates with years of coding experience. So I supported them and work on the visuals and the level design.</p>
							<h5>We won the unoffiial jury's favorite award.</h5><br>

							<p>Basically with the same team as our first WonderJam, we won the jam on our second attempt. I was scripting a lot of dialogs, helping with the visuals and the sound effects.</p>

							<p>At this point in my studies, I was enjoying WonderJams so much I wanted to help others participate and spread the joy. So that year we had a completely different team with 4 newbies. I focused on sound effects, music and animations.</p>

							<br><h4>Sumo resto</h4><br>
							<p> As part of the class <a href="http://cours.uqac.ca/8GIF180">réalisation d'un jeu vidéo</a> I teamed up with 3 devs from UQAC and 5 artists from Centre NAD. This game was a prototype mobile game using motion detection (gyroscope).</p><br>

							<h4>Inner Strike</h4><br>
							<p>As a follow up to the previous video game design, an even bigger team of 8 devs and a dozen artists teammed up to explore one of the game concept and polish it. I mostly worked on tools for devs and visual feedback for players.</p>

							<p>Teaming up with 3 devs from UQAC, 4 artists from Centre NAD and 2 sound designers, we partook in the Ubisoft Game Lab in 2017. There were major design constraints imposed as part of this 10 week game jam that also were worth 3 university credits. The theme was "playing with time" and they imposed an asymetric multiplayer gameplay as part of the challenge. This was the most intense and amazing experience of all my bachelor's degree. I worked a little bit on the gameplay, but mostly on the user interface and user experience.<br><br>We were nominated for: <br> - Best technical and innovative challenge<br> - Best user experience <br> - Best prototype <br> We won: <br> - Best technical and innovative challenge<br></p>
